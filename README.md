# birthdaydroid

This small app is intended to show a list of upcoming birthdays from the
contact list. Furthermore, a simple widget is planned to get a quick glance
at the next birthdays on the home screen.

### My personal playground

This is my first Android app ever and my first Java app in a very long time.
Therefore, it serves as a playground to get familiar with some of the basic
concepts. Given enough time, it might change a lot. ;-)
