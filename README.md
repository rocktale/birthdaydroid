# birthdaydroid

This small app is intended to show a list of upcoming birthdays from the
contact list. Furthermore, a simple widget is planned to get a quick glance
at the next birthdays on the home screen.

## Freatures

* Basic (simplistic) material design
* List birthdays from the phone contacts including
 * Profile picture
 * Name
 * Date
 * Age at the next birthday
* No ads, spyware or secret calls to remote locations

### Roadmap

* Display remaining days till birthday
* Add simple widget (list view)
* Add localization in English and German
* Improve robustness of contact list parsing
* Add notifications on or before birthdays (optional)

## Supported platforms

So far, it is only tested on a Samsung S7 running Android 7.0 and on the
Android 8.1 emulator image. I have no idea if other devices work as well.

### Warning: This is my personal playground

This is my first Android app ever and my first Java app in a very long time.
Therefore, it serves as a playground to get familiar with some of the basic
concepts and might not even be close to the optimal / right way to do things.
It will most probably change a lot.
